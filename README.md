Task:
Write a React Native application that consists of a single view, 
with 3 boxes in it. On startup, in each box, a random single digit number should appear.

Below the boxes there should be a button with the text "Generate" in it. 
When a user clicks the "Generate" button, each box will show a new random digit.  
The application should make use of a redux store for storing its state.

At the bottom of the view there should be another button, "Show Log". 
When a user clicks the "Show Log" button, a pop up box should appear, 
showing a log of all of the generated numbers so far, with 3 numbers in each line. 
The log of generated numbers should not be saved in the redux store.
